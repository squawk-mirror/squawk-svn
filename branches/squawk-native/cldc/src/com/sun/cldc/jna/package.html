This package contains classes that help provide access to native data structures and functions.

The classes names were chosen to resemble the Java Native Access (JNA) APIs, to the extent that 
this made sense on CLDC, and time allowed. Perhaps this could be morphed into a CLDC impl. of JNA someday...

<h3>Differences from JNA</h3>
There are specific differences listed for each class, but here are the major differences: 
<ul>
    <li> No reflection in CLDC means that operations such as function invocation and the reading and writing of Structure fields to native buffers
         has to be done explicitly, not handled automatically. A future version may be able to generate this code automatically though.
    <li> No NIO buffers
    <li> The Pointer type is modelled after the RawMemoryFloatAccess class from RTSJ (JSRT 1).

    <li> Throws RuntimeExceptions instead of UnsatisfiedLinkErrors. Are link errors really "unrecoverable"? Platform independant code might want to work around missing functions.
    <li> Calling conventions unimplemented
    <li> no finalization in cldc
    <li> No classes representing types (IntegerType, PointerType, etc)
    <li> No support for TypeMapper, TypeConverter, FunctionMapper, InvocationMapper, etc.
    <li> No support for Callbacks
</ul>
