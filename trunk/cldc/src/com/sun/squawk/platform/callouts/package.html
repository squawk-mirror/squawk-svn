This package contains classes that help provide access to native data structures and functions.

The classes names were chosen to resemble the Java Native Access (JNA) APIs, to the extent that 
this made sense on J2ME, and time allowed. Perhaps this could be morphed into a J2ME impl. of JNA someday...
